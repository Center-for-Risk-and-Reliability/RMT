Life from Life Strain Properties

\description{
Computes the strain-life (in fatigue cycles \eqn{N_f} and reversals) for a given set of strain-life parameters and conditions.

\usage{
lifestrain.life.trace(strain_amp,E,b,c,sig_f,eps_f,stressunits,options)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{strain_amp}{
    Total strain amplitude \eqn{\epsilon_a}.
  }
  \item{E}{
    Modulus of elasticity \eqn{E} of the material (in MPa or ksi).  This needs to be in the same units as that of \code{sig_f}.
  }
  \item{b}{
      Fatigue strength exponent \eqn{b}.
  }
  \item{c}{
      Fatigue ductility exponent \eqn{c}.
  }
  \item{sig_f}{
      Fatigue strength coefficient \eqn{\sigma_f'} (in MPa or ksi).  This needs to be in the same units as that of \code{E}.
  }
  \item{eps_f}{
      Fatigue ductility coefficient \eqn{\epsilon_f'}.
  }
  \item{stressunits}{
      Defines the units for the stress amplitude: \code{1} for \emph{'MPa'} and \code{2} for \emph{'ksi'}.  \emph{'MPa'} will be used as default if this heading is left empty.
  }
  \item{options}{
    Optional input list made up of information known about the mean-stress correction model primarily.  This heading may be left blank if the \emph{Coffin-Mason model} is assumed (default).
    \deqn{\epsilon_a = \sigma_f'/E (2 N_f)^b + \epsilon_f' (2 N_f)^c}
    Other models may be applied by entering one of the following as \code{mean_stress_corr} along with other necessary properites such as mean stress \eqn{\sigma_m} (enter as \code{Sm}), stress amplitude \eqn{\sigma_a} (enter as \code{stress_amp}, the Walker parameter \eqn{\gamma} (enter as \code{gam}, and load ratio \eqn{R} (enter as \code{R} or you may enter stress range as a vector \code{stressrange})).  These options include:
    \enumerate{
        \item \strong{Morrow mean-stress correction} - (enter as "Morrow")
            \deqn{\epsilon_a = (\sigma_f' - \sigma_m)/E (2 N_f)^b + \epsilon_f' (2 N_f)^c}
        \item \strong{Modified Morrow mean-stress correction} - (enter as "ModifiedMorrow")
            \deqn{\epsilon_a = (\sigma_f' - \sigma_m)/E (2 N_f)^b + \epsilon_f' ((\sigma_f' - \sigma_m)/\sigma_f')^(c/b) (2 N_f)^c}
        \item \strong{Smith-Watson-Topper mean-stress correction} - (enter as "SWT")
            \deqn{\sigma_max \epsilon_a = (\sigma_a + \sigma_m) \epsilon_a = (\sigma_f'^2)/E (2 N_f)^2b + \sigma_f'\epsilon_f' (2 N_f)^(b+c)}
        \item \strong{Walker mean-stress correction} - (enter as "Walker")
            \deqn{\epsilon_a = (\sigma_f'/E) ((1 - R)/2)^(1-\gamma) (2 N_f)^b + \epsilon_f' ((1 - R)/2)^((c/b)(1-\gamma)) (2 N_f)^c}

Bayesian Accelerated Degradation Testing Estimator
}
\description{
Computes Bayesian posterior of degradation model parameters based on either a lognormal or normal degradation fit.

adt.full.BAYES(data, lifedam, dist, D0, Tuse, confid, priors, nsamples, burnin)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
A matrix that represents a data set series which may consist of the following:
\itemize{
  \item{
  Column 1 consists of the time or life entries which correspond to a degradation value.  Data must consist of real and finite numbers.
  }
  \item{
  Column 2 is the degradation value that corresponds to a specific time or life value (Column 1).
  }
  \item{
  Column 3 defines the label for the specific unit number for a given set of degradation data.  For example, the first four entries of this column may be labeled 'Unit 1' which labels the degradation for that particular unit while the following five entries may be labeled 'Unit 2' which represents that unit's degradation.
  }
  \item{
  Column(s) 4 (and on for multi-type stress) states the stress (or step-stress) values for each data in columns 1 and 2.  List one stress type per column (i.e. Column 4 - Temperature and Column 5 - Humidity).
  }
  }
  }
  \item{lifedam}{
The degradation-life model definition for analysis.  Choose from the list of degradation-life models outlined in \code{\link{adt.rank}}.
}
  \item{dist}{
  The distribution that represents time or life.
  \enumerate{
  \item \strong{Normal} (Enter as "Normal".  See more on \code{\link{probplot.nor}}.)
  \item \strong{Lognormal} (Enter as "Lognormal".  See more on \code{\link{probplot.logn}}.)
  }
}
  \item{D0}{
The degradation limit (or endurance limit) where "pseudo" failure times are defined.
}
  \item{Tuse}{
(\emph{Optional}) The use-level temperature which is needed only if the \emph{Hamada degradation-life model} is selected in \code{lifedam}.  If left blank, room temperature (293.15 \eqn{K}) is assumed for this temperature.
}
  \item{confid}{
The confidence in the maximum likelihood parameter estimates entered as a probability between \eqn{0} and \eqn{1}.  Default is \eqn{0.95} (or \eqn{95\%})
}
  \item{priors}{
A vector of prior distributions assigned to each of the parameters for the model (must be entered in the same order as \code{ptest}).  Because this procedure makes use of RStan, the priors shall adhere to the notation there-in.

\enumerate{
  \item \strong{Uniform (non-informative)} ~ \code{uniform(a low bound, b upper bound)}
  \item \strong{Normal} ~ {normal(mu mean, sigma standard deviation)}
  \item \strong{Lognormal} ~ \code{lognormal(mu logmean, sigma log standard deviation)}
  \item \strong{Exponential} ~ \code{exponential(lambda inverse scale)}
  \item \strong{Weibull} ~ \code{weibull(beta shape, alpha scale)}
  \item \strong{Gamma} ~ \code{gamma(alpha shape, beta scale)}
  \item \strong{Beta} ~ \code{beta(alpha shape, beta scale)}
}

Example: \code{priors<-c("normal(3,4)","normal(1,4)", "lognormal(-2,3)")}.  Any other distribution types that may not be on the list type in \code{lookup()} to see RStan's notation.
}
  \item{nsamples}{
The number of samples each Markov chain will produce.
}
  \item{burnin}{
The number of initial iterations to drop from the final Markov chain.
}
}
\details{
This script uses R's Stan library to formulate a stan file specific to the entered degradation-life model and parameter priors therein.  The created Stan file runs a full Bayesian analysis based on four Markov chains per run (number of will be controlled in future versions of the library).

\section{Warning }{
RStan is currently unable to compile stan code for R and Rtools versions 4.2 and higher.  Stan developers are working on this but suggest downloading older versions of Rtools for now (\link{https://blog.mc-stan.org/2022/04/26/stan-r-4-2-on-windows/}).  Meanwhile with regard to the development of this toolkit, a temporary workaround is being developed.

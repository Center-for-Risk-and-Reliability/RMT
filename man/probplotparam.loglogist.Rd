\title{
Log-logistic Probability Plot Parameters
}
\description{
Computes least-squares parameter estimates for log-logistic probability distribution for preparation for logistic  probability plotting.
}
\usage{
probplotparam.loglogist(xi,F)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{xi}{
  A vector consisting of the failure or primary event data in a given set.  Data must consist of real and finite numbers.
  }
  \item{F}{
  A vector of non-parametric estimates for unreliability \eqn{F} at data \code{xi}.
  }
}
\details{
The Log-logistic distribution is positively bounded (\eqn{x \geq 0}) and consists of a log-logistic location parameter \eqn{\mu} and a log-logistic scale parameter \eqn{\sigma}.

  PDF:
  \deqn{f(x) = \frac{\exp(\frac{\ln(x) - \mu}{\sigma})}{\sigma x [1+\exp(\frac{\ln(x) - \mu}{\sigma})]^2}}

  CDF:

  \deqn{F(x) = \frac{\exp(\frac{\ln(x) - \mu}{\sigma})}{1+\exp(\frac{\ln(x) - \mu}{\sigma})}}
}
\value{
Returns several parameters for a single probability plot from a set of data \code{xi}.

\item{x_p at (0.1\% and 99.9\%)}{
  Returns the \eqn{x_{p\;at\;0.1\%}} and \eqn{x_{p\;at\;99.9\%}} based on a log-logistic distribution.  \code{probplot.loglogist} uses this output to plot the best-fit line on the log-logistic probability plots.
}
\item{fcB}{
Returns the transformed y-axis parameter for probabilities \eqn{0.1}\% and \eqn{99.9}\%.  For the log-logistic plot the y-axis is \eqn{\ln (\frac{1}{F} - 1)}.  \code{probplot.loglogist} uses this output to plot the best-fit line on the log-logistic probability plots.
}
\item{logistresults}{
  The least squares estimates for the log-logistic location parameter \eqn{\mu} and a log-logistic scale parameter \eqn{\sigma}.
}
\item{R2}{
  Coefficient of determination \eqn{R^2}.

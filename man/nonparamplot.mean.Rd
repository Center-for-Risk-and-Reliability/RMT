\title{
Mean Non-Parametric Plot
}
\description{
Nonparametric plot based on Mean (or "Expected" or "Weibull") Plottng Position of either failure probability or unreliability, reliability, hazard function, or cumulative hazard
}
\usage{
nonparamplot.mean(xi, rc, relfcn, confbnd, xlabel)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{xi}{
  A vector consisting of the failure or primary event data in a given set.  Data must consist of real and finite numbers.
  }
  \item{rc}{
  A vector consisting of the right censored data of a given set of data.  Data must consist of real and finite numbers.
  }
  \item{relfcn}{
Name of the non-parametric curve to plot.  For (1) \emph{failure probability} or \emph{unreliability} \eqn{F(x)} enter \strong{"unreliability"}.  For (2) \emph{reliability} \eqn{R(x)} enter \strong{"reliability"}.  For (3) \emph{hazard function} \eqn{h(x)} enter \strong{"hazard"}.  Finally for (4) \emph{cumulative hazard function} \eqn{H(x)} enter \strong{"cumulativehazard"}.
}
  \item{confbnd}{
Confidence interval set to the nonparametric output (enter \eqn{95 \%} confidence interval as "95")
}
  \item{xlabel}{
Label for the x-axis for the plot.  If left blank, the default label is "X".
}
}
\details{
Definition of \emph{Mean} (or \emph{Expected}) plotting position equation for failure probability (or unreliability) \eqn{F(x)}:
\deqn{F_i(x_i) = \frac{i}{n + 1}}
}
\value{
Outputs the matrix of non-parametric mean point estimates and upper and lower confidence limits of unreliability, reliability, hazard function, and cumulative hazard function versus the random variable \eqn{x}.  Output also includes the nonparametric plot stated by \code{relfcn} input.

\title{
Mean Non-Parametric Output Tabulation
}
\description{
Tabulation of nonparametric computations based on Mean (also known as "Expected" or "Weibull") Plotting Position (failure probability or unreliability, reliability, hazard, cumulative hazard, and probability distribution).
}
\usage{
plotposit.mean(i, xi, rc)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{i}{
Rank of the failure data set \code{xi}.
}
  \item{xi}{
  A vector consisting of the failure or primary event data in a given set.  Data must consist of real and finite numbers.
  }
  \item{rc}{
  A vector consisting of the right censored data of a given set of data.  Data must consist of real and finite numbers.
  }

\details{
Definition of \emph{Mean} (or \emph{Expected}) plotting position equation for failure probability (or unreliability) \eqn{F(x)}:
\deqn{F_i(x_i) = \frac{i}{n + 1}}
For survival probability (or reliability) \eqn{R(x)}:
\deqn{R_i(x_i) = \frac{n - i + 1}{n + 1}}
For cumulative hazard \eqn{H(x)}:
\deqn{H_i(x_i) = -\ln\left(\frac{n - i + 1}{n + 1}\right)}
\deqn{\text{or }H_i(x_i) = \ln\left(n + 1\right) - \ln\left(n - i + 1\right)}
For hazard rate \eqn{h(x)}:
\deqn{h_i(x_i) = \frac{1}{(n - i + 1)(x_{i+1}-x_i)}}
For probability density \eqn{f(x)}:
\deqn{f_i(x_i) = \frac{1}{(n + 1)(x_{i+1}-x_i)}}
}
\value{
Returns a matrix of nonparameter estimates for each failure data xi: Column 2 is the \emph{failure probability}, Column 3 is the \emph{reliability}, Column 4 is the \emph{hazard rate}, Column 5 is the \emph{cumulative hazard}, and Column 6 is the \emph{probability density}.

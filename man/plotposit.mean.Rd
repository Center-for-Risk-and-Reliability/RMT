\title{
Mean Non-Parametric Output Tabulation
}
\description{
Tabulation of nonparametric computations based on Mean (also known as "Expected" or "Weibull") Plotting Position (failure probability or unreliability, reliability, hazard, cumulative hazard).
}
\usage{
plotposit.mean(i, xi, rc)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{i}{
Rank of the failure data set \code{xi}.
}
  \item{xi}{
  A vector consisting of the failure or primary event data in a given set.  Data must consist of real and finite numbers.
  }
  \item{rc}{
  A vector consisting of the right censored data of a given set of data.  Data must consist of real and finite numbers.
  }
}
\details{
Definition of \emph{Mean} (or \emph{Expected}) plotting position equation for failure probability (or unreliability) \eqn{F(x)}:
\deqn{F_i(x_i) = \frac{i}{n + 1}}
}
\value{
Returns a matrix of nonparameter estimates for each failure data xi: Column 2 is the \emph{failure probability}, Column 3 is the \emph{reliability}, Column 4 is the \emph{hazard rate}, and Column 5 is the \emph{cumulative hazard}.

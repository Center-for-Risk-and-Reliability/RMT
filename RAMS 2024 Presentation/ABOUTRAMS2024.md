# Reliability Modeling Toolkit: Development, Testing, and Tutorial 

The Reliability Modeling Toolkit (**RMT**) is an R-based library of educational tools specifically designed to execute computationally involved and challenging reliability modeling and analytical calculations.  In 2024 the University of Maryland attended the 70th Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium (RAMS) to present a tutorial on the operation of certain tools related to physics of failure, reliability modeling, and accelerated life testing.
